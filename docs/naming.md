# Naming

A few clean, fitting associations for **“el”** that align with what you're building:

### 1. **El → “Elevated / Enlightened / Enhanced”**

Short, sharp, and modern.
Matches an assistant that extends your system’s capabilities.

### 2. **El → From Semitic languages: “strength / power”**

In Hebrew and related languages, _el_ means “god/power/force”.
Symbolically fits an assistant with system-level reach.

### 3. **El → Elemental**

As in “fundamental unit” of your system.
Your AI acts like a core building block within your machine.

### 4. **El → L (Linux)**

A subtle reference to _Linux_ itself.
Feels native to your environment, especially Arch/i3.

### 5. **El → Electric / Electron**

Tech-flavored identity.
Energy + computation feel.

---

All of these align with the tone of a minimal, powerful, on-device AI agent that lives inside your Arch machine.
Your assistant “el” fits nicely as a short internal command (`el run`, `el do`, `el info`).
